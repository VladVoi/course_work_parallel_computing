# Inverted index
## Ð¡oursework in parallel computing
Program start instructions:
1. For serial implementation of the index:
To build an inverted index using the serial method, you need to open the **BuildIndexSerial.class**, change the file path to the one you need and run this class.
2. For parallel implementation of the index:
To build an inverted index using the parallel method, you need to open the **BuildIndex.class**, change the file path to the one you need and change the number of threads you need.
